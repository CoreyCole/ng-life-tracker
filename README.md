# NgLifeTracker
The goal of this project is to make it quick-and-easy to track tasks in your life.
I was inspired by the user experience of [Strong Lifts](https://stronglifts.com/)
but I want to make it more flexible to custom workout regimines.
Also, I wanted to extend it to other areas of life (meals, runs, etc.).
